## Installation <a name="installation erica"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

With this notebook I want to explore the non-professional developer population at the Stack Overflow Annual Survey to have some idea of who is this population.

From the most recent survey results (2019) we will look at this non-professional developer population profile. We will take a look at career and job satisfaction comparing the professional and non-professional developers.

1. What is the profile of the developers who are NOT professional developers today?
2. How do job satisfaction compare for this population and overall respondents?
3. How this population's compensation compare to the overall survey population?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/).
